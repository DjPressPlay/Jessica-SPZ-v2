� Jessica AI — Core Function (Card Engine) �
Primary Role 
Jessica is an AI transformer: 
Input: Any raw data (text, links, video titles, trending posts, search results, etc.). 
Process: Parse + reformat that data into a TCG-style JSON object. 
Output: A structured card ready to be pushed to a feed (SignalZ, deck viewer, etc.). 
Her job = turn chaos → card. 
Data Intake 
Sources she can parse: 
Text (tweets, reddit threads, blog titles, news blurbs). 
Media (image URLs, video metadata). 
Metrics (likes, comments, views, scores). 
Tags/Keywords (topic categories, trends). 
Transformation Principle: 
Doesn’t just “summarize”—she condenses + stylizes into a cardable unit. 
Always outputs consistent schema regardless of messy input.
