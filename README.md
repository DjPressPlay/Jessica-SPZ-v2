Jessica-SPZ V2 — Quick Guide

Jessica is your instant page & card maker.
Paste a few links, and she transforms them into a polished ZETSU-style preview — normal pages or collectible TCG-inspired cards.

What Jessica Does

You paste your links — products, articles, videos, or anything worth showing.

Jessica grabs the best parts:

Images

Titles

Descriptions

She builds your output in two possible modes:

Normal Page — clean, minimal, ready to share

ZETSU Cards — TCG-inspired layouts with rarity, effects, and tags

You get an instant preview — no installs, no waiting.

How to Use

Open Jessica in your browser.

Paste 1–6 links into the input box.

Choose your mode:

Normal (simple SporeZ page)

ZETSU (Jessica TCG cards)

Click Run — Jessica crawls and fuses the content.

Click Preview — see the page or card set instantly.

(Optional) Publish — push it live with one click.

Example Uses

Showcase products — drop store links, auto-create a product page or card deck.

Curate reading — paste articles, get a clean digest or collectible info cards.

Hybrid mix — combine products, socials, and news into a ZETSU-style set.

Session play — use Jessica as part of your creative “feed loops” in SPZ or SignalZ.

Tips for Best Results

High-quality links = stronger previews.

Public pages only (Jessica can’t read login-walls).

Best flow: 3–6 links per session.

Switch between Normal and ZETSU modes depending on your project.
